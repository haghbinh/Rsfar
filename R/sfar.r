#' sfar: A Package for Seasonal Functional Autoregressive Models.
#'
#' The sfar package provides the collection of necessary
#' functions for simulating, estimating and forecasting seasonal functional
#' autoregressive (SFAR) time series of order one.
#'
#'@details
#' Functional autoregressive models are popular for functional time series analysis, but
#' the standard formulation fails to address seasonal behavior in functional time series data.
#' To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce seasonal functional autoregressive time series
#' models. For the model of order one, we provide estimation, prediction and simulation methods.
